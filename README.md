# [USA Birth Names: Project Overview](https://github.com/jakeockerby/USA-Birth-Names)
- Created a tool that analysizes and visualises USA birth name data from 1880-2018
- Made a graph visualising total births by year
- Grouped together the most popular 1000 names each year and produced a graph showing the percentage of given names that fall in the top 1000 over time
- Shown how the popularity of specific names vary over time
- Produced 2 bar graphs showing the most popular first letter in names over time, for male and female
